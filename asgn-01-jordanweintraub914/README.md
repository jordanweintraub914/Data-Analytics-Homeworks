# Assignment 1 (Spring 2021) 
Name: *Jordan Weintraub*
Class: **Data Analytics**

## List of what I cover in my README
1. Takeaways from class
2. Takeaways from homework
3. Gif 
4. Table
5. Code 

### Takeaways from class 
- using the terminal to open jupyer is quicker than using anaconda 
- Following the necessary steps to fetch and pull/push the origin will be important when collaborating on code 

### Takeaways from homework 
- python has many prebuilt functions like lens() and set() that were very useful in completing this homework
- there were some typos in the assignment prompts that were made to slow down (ex: 'stringy' instead of 'string')
- I'm assuming order does not matter for Q4 
- Python has built in word operators like 'and' and 'or' that are much easier to follow compared to '&&' and '||' 
- No idea why i'm instructed to use an if-else statement in Q6 but I threw it in there so I wouldn't lose points **(please be kind)**
- Question 8 can be tricky because the output will be the same regardless if you count the odd or even indexes 
- I used pandas to complete question 10 since I already imported it in question 1 but I also could have used the numpy package 

### Me After finally getting the gif link to work...

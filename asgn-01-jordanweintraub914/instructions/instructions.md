# Assignment 1 - Due Sunday Feb 14 at 8pm

Let's practice the tools we cover in the first two weeks: GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Markdown, and Jupyter (Python). We will:

1. Clone a repo to our computer
2. Use python to solve problems inside of a .ipynb file 
3. Make an informative README.md file
4. Add a .gitignore file and clean up the _online_ repo 

## Work on the python file

There is a python file inside this repo. Open it, and follow the directions inside of it. 

**When you are done with the problems, clear the output and rerun all cells.**

## Edit the readme file 

Make the readme file informative and professional. Change the title of it (not the filename, the title at the top), and summarize some of your takeaways from what you've learned so far in the class. 

I'm not grading this for content or length. So include whatever you think is helpful to your learning process to reiterate. And have fun with it! 

Use the following markdown features in your readme:
1. At least 2 levels of headers
1. Bold
1. Italics
1. Insert a gif or picture
1. A table
1. A list
1. A snippet of code (formatted as code)

## Finish the repo for submission - .gitignore

1. Modify the .gitignore file so that when you run the python file, it won't sync the temporary file it creates to the origin.
2. Clear all outputs from the python file and rerun all cells. 

Sync your repo and then check out how the **online repo** looks. 
1. It should only have these files: 
	1. .gitignore
	2. README.md 
	3. temp/wine.csv
	4. instructions/instructions.md
	5. instructions/rubric.md
	6. asgn01exercises.ipynb
1. The python file, when you view it online, should show all the outputs from your answers, with consecutively numbered outputs.

    - Is it informative and professional?
    - Did they change the title of it?

    - How many grammar or formatting errors are there? (0 or 1, 2 or more)
- Python file: 90%
    - When you look at the python file _**in the repo online,**_ can you see the outputs from the code? 
    - Are those outputs numbered consecutively from 1 upwards? Put no if you can't see the output online. 
    - GRADER: clone this repo to your computer and run the file. Did it run without error?
    - Correct answers to questions
- gitignore: 5%
    - The online repo should only have these files: .gitignore, README.md, instructions/instructions.md, instructions/rubric.md, asgn03exercises.ipynb, and any files I put in the data folder
    - Did they modify `.gitignore` to include an auxiliary files produced when they worked on the code?

## How we will grade the peer review 

1. Accuracy and honor code: 80% 
	- We check 25% of peer reviews at random. Errors in reviews will reduce your peer evaluation grade 
	- If your review is materially wrong, we will audit all of your reviews for the semester and adjust those grades and yours accordingly. 
	- We will also check reviews if your reviewee thinks your review is materially wrong, mean spirited, or if we are told of academic honest violations. 
2. Feedback quality on remarks: 20%

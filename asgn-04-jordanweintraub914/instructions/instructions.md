# Assignment 4 - Due Sunday Mar 7 at 8pm EST

We're getting our graphing on.

## Work on the python file

There is a python file inside this repo. Open it, and follow the directions inside of it. 

**When you are done with the problems, clear the output and rerun all cells.**

## Edit the readme file 

The readme file should be "publication ready".
- Make the readme file informative and professional. 
- Change the title of it (not the filename, the title at the top)
- Describe the purpose of this repo (what this repo is analyzing) and the key inputs
- List any necessary packages (might a reader need to `pip install` anything?) or steps a visitor will need to run to make it work on their computer  

## Finalize the repo for submission 

1. When you are done working on the python file, clear the output and rerun all cells. You might catch errors you need to fix! 
1. Modify the .gitignore file so that when you run the python file, it won't sync any temporary or nuisance files to the origin repo. 
2. Clear all outputs from the python file and rerun all cells. 

## "Submission"

"Submission" means that you've uploaded work to the origin repo (to github). Simply sync the local repo on your computer (commit and push any work on your computer by using GitHub Desktop). 

Then, as an important check, look at how the **online repo** looks:

1. It should only have these files: 
    1. .gitignore
    2. README.md 
    3. the instruction and rubric files
    4. any data files I provided in the data folder
1. The python file, when you view it online, should show all the outputs from your answers, with consecutively numbered outputs.

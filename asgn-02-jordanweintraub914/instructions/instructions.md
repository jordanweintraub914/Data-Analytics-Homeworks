# Assignment 2 - Due Sunday Feb 21 at 8pm EST

Let's practice the golden rules (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.2.5), flex our new `pandas` muscles, and begin some light finance applications. We will:

1. Use two datasets with different observation levels (one is annual, another is daily).
2. Calculate and analyze the distribution of stock returns.
3. Implement the pandas golden rules and data cleaning in our code.

## Work on the python file

There is a python file inside this repo. Open it, and follow the directions inside of it. 

**When you are done with the problems, clear the output and rerun all cells.**

## Edit the readme file 

The readme file should be "publication ready".
- Make the readme file informative and professional. 
- Change the title of it (not the filename, the title at the top)
- Describe the purpose of this repo (what this repo is analyzing) and the key inputs
- List any necessary packages (might a reader need to `pip install` anything?) or steps a visitor will need to run to make it work on their computer  

## Finalize the repo for submission 

1. When you are done working on the python file, clear the output and rerun all cells. You might catch errors you need to fix! 
1. Modify the .gitignore file so that when you run the python file, it won't sync any temporary or nuisance files to the origin repo. 
2. Clear all outputs from the python file and rerun all cells. 

## "Submission"

"Submission" means that you've uploaded work to the origin repo (to github). Simply sync the local repo on your computer (commit and push any work on your computer by using GitHub Desktop). 

Then, as an important check, look at how the **online repo** looks:

1. It should only have these files: 
	1. .gitignore
	2. README.md 
    3. the instruction and rubric files
1. The python file, when you view it online, should show all the outputs from your answers, with consecutively numbered outputs. 

## A few comments

**Relax about the following things:**

- Tidying/reshaping is NOT your assignment. Some of your tables may be awkwardly shaped in the report. That’s OK.
- Table beauty is not a big deal. Simply printing to “screen” is fine.
- (Later in the semester, easier-to-read tables will be more important, but it's early, and I want you to concentrate on getting the concrete parts of the analysis right.)

**Tip: Treat this assignment as a “cheat sheet” for future-you!** Don’t assume that you’ll remember the lessons you learned while writing this assignment. Write things down:

- Add notes on difficulties/oddities you encountered. For example, which tables/figures are easy/hard to make, which data formats make better inputs for plotting functions or for human-friendly tables.
- Provide attribution whenever you take code or an idea from somewhere else, whether a blog post, a colleague, a vignette, etc. Putting those pointers in your “cheat sheet” will be useful for future-you – and it’s just good practice to indicate where you got things from. It also protects you on the plagiarism front.
